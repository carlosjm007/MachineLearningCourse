<h2>Practical Machine Learning</h2>
<h3>Carlos Jos√© Manosalva</h3>
<h3>September 30, 2017</h3>

<p>This document has been written to complete the machine learning course.</p>

<p>First of all, We are going to define the librarys:</p>

<!--begin.rcode
library(caret);
library(rpart);
end.rcode-->

<p>In this part, we are going to load the data from "http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har" they offered this information about personal activity taken from his devices; in this case, the data comes from people who made barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.</p>

<p>Our target is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.</p>
<!--begin.rcode
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv");
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv");
end.rcode-->

<p>To do a good job, We will clean data from the variables where exist more than 50% na records and we will delete columns where we'll cannot find variability through the rows</p>
<!--begin.rcode
i_nzv <- nearZeroVar(training, saveMetrics=TRUE);
training <- training[, !i_nzv$nzv];

i_nrows <- nrow(training);
i_names_columns <- c();
i_dataRmNA <- c();
for(i in names(training)){
	if (i != "classe"){
			dataRmNA <- sum(is.na(training[,c(i)]));
			if (!(dataRmNA > (i_nrows*0.5))){
				i_names_columns <- c(i_names_columns, i);
			}
	}
};

training <- training[, c(i_names_columns,"classe")];
testing <- testing[, i_names_columns];
end.rcode-->

<p>To do tests, We are going to split the data</p>
<!--begin.rcode
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE);

i_training <- training[inTrain,];
i_testing <- training[-inTrain,];
end.rcode-->


<p>We are going to use the decision tree algorithm in our model:</p>
<!--begin.rcode
set.seed(2233);

modelFit <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=i_training, method="class");
modelFit
end.rcode-->

<p>As you can see, I have made a terrible mistake, the decision tree only uses the X column because is an enumeration of the rows, we have to delete that column.</p>
<!--begin.rcode
i_training$X = NULL;
end.rcode-->

<p>So we are going to train again and prove the model.</p>
<!--begin.rcode
modelFit <- train(classe ~., data=i_training, method = "svmLinear");

i_testing$classtesting <- predict(modelFit, newdata = i_testing)

confusionMatrix(i_testing$classtesting, i_testing$classe)
end.rcode-->

<p>With the confusionMatrix we can see this is a good model.</p>
<p>Now we'll use the test data to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.</p>
<!--begin.rcode
testing$testpre <- predict(modelFit, newdata = testing)
for(i in 1:length(testing$testpre)){
	filename = paste0("case_",i,".txt")
	write.table(testing$testpre[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
}
end.rcode-->

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The first prediction model, when the data was splitted to train the decision tree, we didn't discriminate the X column, this can show good results when the same data are predicted, but it is not usefull with other data.</p>
